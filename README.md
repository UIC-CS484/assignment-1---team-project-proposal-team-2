<h3>Team members</h3>
Malika Yelyubayeva </br>
Nikita Parovoy

<h3>Strategy</h3>
We were thinking about first designing and then implementing the game. All the tasks are divided between two team members equally, and in case of non-sequential tasks, two people will be working at the same time.
</br>
For creating this project the Battle.net api will be used along with the other alike apis that will provide items data.

<h3>Development tools</h3>
- VScode </br>
- Postman
